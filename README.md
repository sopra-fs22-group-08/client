# SoPra FS22 Group 08 - NoBrainer

## Introduction

Our project aims to create an alternative flashcard learning tool to the big names
of 'Anki' and 'Quizlet'.
We try to make learning as easy and seamless as possible and the feedback unobtrusive.

## Technologies

The project is written in JavaScript, SCSS and HTML. The deployment happens on Heroku.

## High-Level Components

- [`Header`](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-08/client/blob/master/src/components/ui/Header.js):  contains the Logo and the burgermanue with home the user can navigate through the app.

- [`Home`](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-08/client/blob/master/src/components/views/Home.js):  contains the players public and privat cards and the invitations to games.

- [`CardOverview`](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-08/client/blob/master/src/components/views/CardOverview.js):  contains the overview of the Card Deck, the possibilty to edit, learn and challenge the deck.


## Launch & Deployment


For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```bash
npm install
```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits.

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
